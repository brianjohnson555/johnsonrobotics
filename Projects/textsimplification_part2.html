									<h3>Part 2 Summary</h3>
									<p><i>I dive into a Lexical Simplification pipeline using NLP: tokenization, NER, complex word identification,
										finding suitable substitution candidates, and replacing words recursively in the text.
									</i>
									</p>

									<h3>Applying NLP LS approaches to Chinese text</h3>
									<p>To recap my problem, I want to implement a lexical simplification (LS) pipeline for simplifying Chinese sentences. 
										While NLP has been revolutionized by the use of large language models (LLMs) like GPT, previous NLP techniques 
										could still be useful as they could be less computationally intensive and do not require long training times with
										large amounts of data. Because the approach is rather simplified, I only aim for lexical Simplification
										(word replacement) rather than a complex sentence simplification with grammatical and structural changes. I will
										save the complete text simplification method for my BART model in Part 3.
									</p>

									<p>I will implement a custom LS approach shown in the diagram below. To summarize, we (1) perform named entity recognition
										(NER), (2) find complex words in the sentence, (3) find candidate words for substitution, (4) determine the best fit
										among the candidates, and (5) replace the word in the sentence. This occurs recursively, so a sentence with multiple
										complex words will be simplified word-by-word. I include the additional step of NER so that named entities are not
										accidentally simplified, which would alter or destroy significant meaning of the sentence.
									</p>

									</div>

									<p>Some context on Chinese language: the individual words of a sentence are comprised of characters, of which there are 
										many thousands. Words are typically one, two, or three characters long. Expressions can be three or four characters long
										(e.g. similar to English terms like "social media", a single concept described across two words). A benefit of 
										implementing LS in Chinese is that individual Chinese characters and words are immutable. The characters of a word
										do not change based on subject, object, gender, number, or tense (having some experience with the German language, 
										fellow learners can understand the frustration of a single verb mapping to 10+ different conjugation forms).
										Therefore, it is very easy from a syntactic perspective to replace a complex word with a simple one: the only difficulty
										is identifying which words are complex, and what synonyms or similar words can serve as substitutions. 
									</p>

									<h3>Step 1: Recognizing complex Chinese words and Named Entities</h3>
									<p>
										For any NLP task, the first step of the process is tokenization. I will use the Chinese NLP package jieba for
										easy tokenization of our text:
									</p>	

									<pre class="language-py" style="text-align: left"><code class="language-py">
import jieba

# tokenize sentence:
tokens = jieba.lcut(sentence)
tokens = [token for token in tokens if not re.match(r'^\W+$', token)] # remove punctuation
									</code></pre>

									<p>
										Now that the sentence is split into tokens, let's perform <b>named entity recognition (NER)</b>. 
										This identifies	named entities like names, places, organizations, etc which should not be simplified (e.g. you 
										can't reduce the complexity of "Barack Obama" or "Amsterdam"). In Python, I use the
										modelscope package with a pre-trained pipeline from DAMO Academy Alibaba:
									</p>

									<pre class="language-py" style="text-align: left"><code class="language-py">
from modelscope.pipelines import pipeline
from modelscope.utils.constant import Tasks
ner_pipeline = pipeline(Tasks.named_entity_recognition, 
						'damo/nlp_raner_named-entity-recognition_chinese-base-news')
										
ner_output = ner_pipeline(sentence)['output'] # run NER pipeline, generate tokens
tokens_ner = list(set([d['span'] for d in ner_output if len(d['span'])>1])) # get NER>1 character
tokens_no_ner = list(set(tokens) - set(tokens_ner)) # get all tokens that are NOT named entities
									</code></pre>

									<h3>Step 2: Identifying complex words</h3>
									<p>
										Now we have a list of tokens, both simple and complex. How do we define simple vs complex? 
										<b>I will take two approaches: first through the token's HSK rating, and second through its frequency
										rating</b>. HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi) is a measure of Chinese proficiency for foreign speakers, and it
										includes a vocabulary list with a total of about 11,000 words ranked from 1 to 9 (1 being beginner level,
										9 being most advanced). While not a perfect capture of difficulty, low-rank HSK words are generally learned
										first and are typically easier to read. So, any word within the HSK vocabulary that is
										above level 5 could be considered "complex", or at least more likely to have a synonym or similar word within
										HSK 1-5. My other measure of complexity is with frequency; words and characters that appear rarely in written
										content are less likely to be known by a reader, and might be replaced with more frequently occurring words.
									</p>

									<p>
										Let's implement complex word identification using some custom-build data structures. For more
										information on how I created these, see my supplementary page.
									</p>

									<pre class="language-py" style="text-align: left"><code class="language-py">
def find_complex_words(tokens: list, HSK_thresh:int, freq_thresh:float):
	complex_HSK = [token for token in tokens if (token in hsk_dict and hsk_dict[token]&gt;HSK_thresh)] # find all tokens above HSK level
	complex_freq = [token for token in tokens if (token in blcu.index and blcu.loc[token].values[0]&lt;freq_thresh)] # find all tokens below freq level
	complex_words = list(set(complex_HSK).union(complex_freq)) # combine by union
	return complex_words

complex_words = find_complex_words(tokens_no_ner, HSK_thresh=5, freq_thresh=0.98)
									</code></pre>

									<h3>Step 3: Finding substitution candidates</h3>
									<p>
										text
									</p>

									<h3>Step 4: Ranking substitution candidates</h3>
									<p>
										text
									</p>

									<h3>Step 5: Replacing words recursively</h3>
									<p>
										text
									</p>

									<h3>Conclusion</h3>
									<p>
										That concludes Part 2 of this project -- an LS pipeline using NLP tools! See the future Part 4 for the
										evaluation of the pipeline on my validation and test data. But for now, let's look at a different approach
										for Part 3: implementing complete sentence simplification by fine-tuning BART.
