									<h2>Chinese Text Simplification for Reading Comprehension (Part 1)</h2>
									<p><i>A personal project in NLP, ML, and BART modeling</i></p>

									<h3>The problem</h3>
									<p>Text simplification (TS) is the process of reducing the linguistic complexity of
										written text in order to improve readability for people with low reading skills, 
										children, non-native speakers, or language learners. A subset of this, called lexical
										simplification (LS), is focused only on reducing the word complexity while the sentence
										structure remains unchanged. As a language learner of Chinese, I became interested in 
										the idea of Chinese TS and LS to serve as a tool to improve my reading abilities.
									</p>
									<p>How can text simplification improve reading skills? Through <i>extensive reading</i> --
										reading passages in which a large amount (about 95%) of the words are understood.
										With this method, readers can focus more on the language's natural cadence and read at
										faster speeds, compared with more <i>intensive</i> reading where a large amount of words
										are unknown and more time is spent looking up new words.
										Because most of the words are understood in extensive reading, it's easier to use context-clues
										to infer the meaning of new vocabulary.
									</p>
									<p><b>My goal is this: implement a Chinese language TS/LS scheme that can accept a wide range
										of text passages as an input, and output a simplified passage with reduce vocabulary complexity
										to promote intensive reading practice.</b>
									</p>
									<p>Chinese language ability is official evaluated with the HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi - Chinese proficiency exam).
										The latest set of HSK vocabulary has cumulative levels from 1 to 9 (HSK1 being beginner level) with a total of about 10,000
										vocabulary words. Because Chinese learners -- including myself -- often use the HSK system as both a study
										tool and a proficiency goal, I aim to specifically focus on HSK-level vocabulary in my TS/LS approach.
									</p>
									

									<h3>My approach</h3>
									<p>My approach is to employ both NLP tools and wider ML models like BART to implement Chinese TS/LS.
										I will focus entirely on Python, which has a vast array of ML and NLP packages and models. I will also
										cover my approach in scraping the text from web URLs and re-generating new html with the simplified text.
										In the next part of this article, I'll describe and break down my first approach: <b>niave LS using jieba package</b>.
