									<h2>Chinese Text Simplification for Reading Comprehension (NLP)</h2>

									<h3>The problem</h3>
									<p>Text simplification is the process of reducing the linguistic complexity of
										written text in order to improve readability for people with low reading skills, 
										children, non-native speakers, or language learners. As a language learner of Chinese,
										I became interested in the idea of Chinese text simplification to serve as a tool to
										improve my reading abilities.
									</p>
									<p>How can text simplification improve reading skills? Through <i>extensive reading</i> --
										reading passages in which a large amount (about 95%) of the words are understood.
										With this method, readers can focus more on the cadence of the language and read at
										faster speeds, compared with more <i>intensive</i> reading where a large amount of words
										are unknown and time-consuming dictionary lookups are required to progress through the text.
										Because most of the words are understood in intensive reading, it's easier to use context-clues
										to infer the meaning of new vocabulary.
									</p>
									<p>Chinese language is often evaluated with HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi, 汉语水平考试 - Chinese proficiency exam).
										The latest set of HSK vocabulary has cumulative levels from 1 to 9 (HSK1 being beginner level) with a total of about 10,000
										vocabulary words. While knowing all 10,000 words won't make you fluent in Chinese, you should be quite proficient.
										Because the HSK is so popular (and used officially in China to evaluate Chinese proficiency similar to ESL 
										exams in the United States or Europe), learning content is often rated for each HSK level - for example, a
										short story might only use words from the HSK3 vocabulary set to make it easier for beginners to read. Unfortunately,
										I've found that HSK-graded content is still limited in volume, making it challenging for <i>extensive readers</i> to read
										material appropriate to their skill level.									
									</p>
									<p>With that said, <b>my goal is this: implement a Chinese language text simplification scheme that can accept a wide range
										of text passages as an input, and replace advanced vocabulary with vocabulary in the HSK system
										graded to the individual's HSK level while retaining overall text meaning.</b>
									</p>

									<h3>My approach</h3>
									<p>My approach to create this text simplification scheme is to use natural language processing (NLP) tools
										at the word and sentence level.
