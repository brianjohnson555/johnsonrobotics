									<h2>An artificial potential field approach for velocity 
										control and object manipulation on shape displays</h2>

									<h3>Summary</h3>
									<p><i>
										Shape displays, devices which can actively alter their surface topology, 
										have promising applications for human-robot-collaboration, haptic interaction, and manufacturing. 
										However, these use-cases are limited due to challenges in dynamic object control on 
										the display surface. In this project, I create a general-purpose, extendable algorithm that 
										enables complete trajectory control of spherical objects via surface rolling.  
										The algorithm can also enable the control of multiple agents on separate trajectories 
										with object avoidance, as well as cooperative formation control. 
										On this project page, I'll describe the algorithm and show experiments that validate its performance.
									</i></p>

									<p style="text-align: center"><a href = "../APF_manuscript_BrianJohnson.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
										Read my pre-print manuscript for full details, equations, and literature references.</a>
									</p>

									<h3>Project introduction</h3>
									<p>
										This work is an off-shoot of the paper that <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39842-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
										my coauthors and I published in Nature Communications</a>. In that work, we built a soft
										robotic shape display with a variety of capabilities. A shape display is a device which can change
										its surface topology using controlled and targeted actuation to different areas of the surface. One 
										of the demonstrations that I implemented in that project was a closed-loop object manipulation scheme
										that could make balls roll around on the surface. While a little bit silly, this application could have 
										valid uses in manufacturing and user-interactivity if improved upon.
									</p>

									<p>My goal is to implement an improved algorithm to control ball motion using the inherent actuation
										properties of our robotic device. I selected a gradient descent (potential field) approach, as this has 
										been successfully applied in many other robotic navigation systems.
									</p>

									<h3>Gradient descent algorithm</h3>
									<p>
										The gradient descent approach is relatively simple. The 'gradient' that the object will follow on any 
										given topology is the height gradient -- it's a direct relationship to the gravitational potential energy
										of the system. Motion is created by the conversion from potential to kinetic energy, and the direction of
										motion will likewise follow the potential energy gradient.
									</p>

									<p>
										In basic terms, my approach is to create a 'hill' for a ball to roll down. The position of the hill relative
										to the ball will determine (a) the amount of energy and therefore the speed that the ball will obtain after
										rolling down the hill, and (b) the direction in which the ball will roll.
									</p>

										<figcaption>Outline of the algorithm. (a) Measure object velocity, 
											(b) Calculate required surface topology, (c) calculate topology position on the device,
										(d) downscale to the device actuator resolution, (e) apply actuation commands, (f) measure new velocity. </figcation>
									</div>

									<p>
										The algorithm can be considered a closed-loop control system, where the velocity (both magnitude and direction)
										is the state vector that is actively measured and controlled.
									</p>

										<figcaption>Pseudo-code representation of the control algorithm. The equations
											referenced are described in detail <a href = "../APF_manuscript_BrianJohnson.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
												in my pre-print manuscript</a>.
										</figcation>
									</div>

									<p>
										The base algorithm of this control method allows me to control the position of a ball on the surface.
										However, the algorithm can also extend to a few other capabilities:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Controlling the entire trajectory via velocity rather than location</li>
										<li>Avoiding obstacles while moving</li>
										<li>Controlling multiple agents at the same time</li>
										<li>Controlling a geometric formation of several agents</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Results</h3>
									<p>
										Before jumping into the performance of the algorithm, here is a brief overview of the hardware I used
										for this project, from my previous <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39842-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
											shape display paper</a>:
									</p>

									<div class="container">
										<a class="image centered"><img src="../images/project_APF/fig_hardware.jpg" style="width:55%;"/></a>
										<figcaption>Hardware and control loop for my experiments. (a) The robotic shape display device consists of
											a 10x10 actuator array with embedded sensors, as well as an overhead camera for object position
											measurement. (b) The closed-loop system operates on the software/sensor-side at 260 Hz, while the
											physical actuation system is updated at a 26 Hz rate. The main measurement is the ball position from
											which I derive an estimate of ball velocity.
										</figcation>
									</div>

									<p>For a full description of the robot, check out the Nature Communications paper linked above. To summarize,
										the device is a 10x10 actuator array with an elastic surface skin. Each actuator has a 60x60 mm footprint,
										an upwards maximum displacement of about 15 mm, and an output force of a few Newtons. I use an overhead USB
										camera to image the display surface, and OpenCV object detection to find the position of a ball on the surface
										using the captured image. I use the ball position to derive velocity, and run through the control algorithm
										described early on this page.
									</p>

									<p>
										With the above set up and control scheme, let's look at real-time video of some of the capabilities:
									</p>

									<div class="container" style="align-content:center">
										<iframe width="560" 
										height="315" 
										style="display:block; margin: auto;"
										src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/HUeL6-QKedM?si=gEKkTzDBK0M_jG8g"
										title="YouTube video player 2" 
										frameborder="0" 
										allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
										referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" 
										allowfullscreen>
										</iframe>
									</div>

									<p>
										You can see that the real-time performance is pretty good! The motion of the ball is rapid
										and well-controlled by the active robotic surface. Here's a more in-depth look at the results
										of three demonstrations:
									</p>

									<div class="container">
										<a class="image centered"><img src="../images/project_APF/fig_results.jpg" style="width:85%;"/></a>
										<figcaption>Results of 10 trials of each experiment: (a) positional control of the ball from one corner to
											another, (b) positional control with an obstacle, (c) trajectory control in a circle using a limit cycle.
											The middle figures show the trajectories of the trials, with the small inlay describing the velocity field
											used for the control scheme. The bottom figures show the normalized velocity error over time.
										</figcation>
									</div>

									<p>
										You can see in (a) that it requires less than 2 seconds to travel about 50 cm, representing rapid object manipulation.
										The trajectory of the ball is very consistent over 10 trials, showing good controllability and minimal overshoot. Similar results
										can be seen for the demonstration in (b), although there is significant overshoot for the limit cycle controller in (c) which
										results in the oscillatory and messy trajectory that you can see there.
									</p>

									<div class="container">
										<a class="image centered"><img src="../images/project_APF/fig_triangle.jpg" style="width:85%;"/></a>
										<figcaption>Formation control of 3 balls, with the ideal formation being an equilateral triangle. Dashed lines
											indicate the ideal formation state.
											(a) The target formation is achieved in about 2.5 seconds, and the (b) side lengths and (c) area of the triangle
											formed between the balls verify that the correct formation is achieved and stabilized in the Lyapunov sense.
										</figcation>
									</div>

									<p>
										The results of formation control are also promising. Here, you can see that the agents in the formation can achieve 
										the target formation and maintain it, albeit with some similar oscillatory effects like those seen in the limit cycle
										demonstration. 
									</p>

									<h3>Future work and conclusion</h3>
									<p>
										The video and figure results that I've shared show that the initial performance of this gradient
										descent/potential field control algorithm are already quite impressive - I can achieve object speeds reaching
										50 cm/s across the surface, acceleration from rest of less than 0.5 s, high positional accuracy, and the ability to
										avoid obstacles, follow trajectories, and form multi-agent formations.
									</p>
									<p>
										Of course, there are still areas where I can make improvements. In the algorithm itself, I can consider more complex
										forces like sliding and rolling friction against the robot surface, which I largely ignored here. I can also fine-tune the
										algorithm hyperparameters to achieve better results for this particular robot and object, even though the mathematics of the
										algorithm itself are hardware-agnostic. I could also improve the real-time performance by increasing the control
										frequency rate -- using a higher fps camera for imaging, and increasing the control loop frequencies for actuation.
									</p>
									<p>
										I hope you've enjoyed this quick introduction and summary of this gradient descent control project. I had a lot
										of fun implementing it and hope it can provide inspiration for your own robotics projects!
